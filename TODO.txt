TODO:
    MRI Slice
        GUI for interaction with Slice object
    Mesh
        Add support for GIFTI
    Fix sliders in mri_fragment (vertical size is not matching parent)
    onResume must update shader references... they could change and cause a crash
    Pop-up view destroys the data

EMERGENCY:

DOING:
    Zoom and Pan with 2 fingers... and rotation (transverse from the view)

Testing if DONE:
    Fix apk install failure
        - changed the android manifest to install only 1 app.

PATCHES TO BE FIXED:
    After zooming, new fov must be updated in shaders. Must implement a function queue or something for smart updating. *****Delete "configPerspective()" in drawing function onDrawFrame.*****

    Status bar, home and back button hiding but must eliminate animation.

    MRI_settings has a patch for the slider and checkboxs that must be programed better. The slider check whether the user created the event in order to valid it. The Checkbox uses the onclickevent to update the draw value, and the is changed to set the current state.

DONE:
    Status bar, home and back button not hiding, need fix

    Delete 'bundle names' from strings.xml and from main activity
