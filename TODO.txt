Testing if DONE:
    Fix apk install failure
        - changed the android manifest to install only 1 app.

PATCHES TO BE FIXED:
    After zooming, new fov must be updated in shaders. Must implement a function queue or something for smart updating. *****Delete "configPerspective()" in drawing function onDrawFrame.*****

    MRI_settings has a patch for the slider and checkboxs that must be programed better. The slider check whether the user created the event in order to valid it. The Checkbox uses the onclickevent to update the draw value, and the is changed to set the current state.
